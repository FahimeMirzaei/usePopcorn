# Getting Started with Create React App

use-Popcorn is a warmup project to practice my Reactjs skills. Its HTML and CSS codes are premade and I just used them to add some React code. So please don't expect too much of CSS skills

unfortunatly the api for fetching movies doesn't work well on low internet speed. So with fast typing to search a movie you may catch some bugs.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
